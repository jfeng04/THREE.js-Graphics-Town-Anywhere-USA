# Anywhere USA project, THREE.js

This set of web pages forms a heavily edited version of my project for the "workbook" assignment for 
CS559, Computer Graphics at the University of Wisconsin for Spring 2024.

To view the project, please right click the index.html file at /THREE.js-Graphics-Town-Anywhere-USA/ and click 'run on live server'. If you do not have live server installed, please do so before running.

Information about the class is available on the course web:
https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp24/

The `for_students` sub-directory contains files that include objects and world-related code.

The `libs` sub-directory contains libraries used by the workbook. These
have separate open source licenses provided in the directories. 

The workbook UI was primarily developed by Prof. Michael Gleicher with
assistance from the course staff, including Young Wu, over the years.

The entire world and project was developed by Justin Feng in 2024-2025.
